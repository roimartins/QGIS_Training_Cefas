# MODULE 0 - INTRODUCTION TO SPATIAL DATA AND GIS USING QGIS

## 1. SPATIAL DATA

- ***What is data:*** Ordered collection of information arranged in rows (records) and columns ( attributes/fields).The rows represent unique records and the columns the attributes related to the records.

| Record id      | attribute 1 | attribute 2 | .....  | attribute n |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |------------|
| item 1      | value       | value       | value       | value       |
| item 2   | value        | value       | value       | value       |
 | ....   | .....        | ....       | ...       | ...       |
| item n   | value        | value       | value       | value       |


> #### EXERCISE 1 - Create a table
> 
>  - Create a table to collect information of the main towns in BVI
>  - What attributes you would include? Add the attributes to your towns table ( population, employe , etc. ) 
>  - Scale the table to include other geographical references of BVI  ( islands, cay, bays , beach , etc.  ). Where you you would indicate the type of location you are including in the table?
>  - Could be all the information be included in a unique table?

- ***What is SPATIAL data:*** Any information collected in the world is related to a spatial location.  


> ***EXERCISE 2***
> 
> - What is the spatial information you can add to the table from Exercise 1 ?
> - How you represent the spatial location of the records in Exercise 1 table (POINT, LINES or POLYGONS)?
> - Add two new columns to your tables to include the geographical information of latitude and longitude
> - Use teh [BVI map](http://www.skyviews.com/british-virgin-islands-map/BVI_Islands_Mapside.jpg) and google maps and get the coordinates in
